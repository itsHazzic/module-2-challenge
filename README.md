## Description

A portfolio of work created to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

To satisfy a typical hiring managers needs, the following features were included:

- When the page is loaded, it presents my name and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- When viewing the section about your work, the section contains titled images of my applications.
- When presented with the first application, in the work section, that application's image is larger in size than the others due to is importance.
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.
